345  <-  F 0 0     Followed by single data read of 07, got F      Mode 1 start
345  <-  F 0 0     Folloed by read f 0F, got F
345  <-  F 4 0     Precedes write of 6 to 03 and ten nibbles. Look like prefixes matrix setup or blanking
345  <-  F C 0     Two of these after 6,4,F matrix? writes then matrix? writes to F,4 (
